the first thing I had to do was figure out how to undo all the changes to my public_html file that I 
had done for a full stack lab from new beginnings.  I tried to just move all the old files out of 
the foler and start over, but then I got server errors.  After reading the readme for the lab I 
realized there was dot file that was handing control of the backend server, so I removed that to 
restore the directory to its original static state 

I wanted to use boot strap to make it look a little more polished; I like how the fonts and everything 
look in bootstrap, because it makes the webpage look like it wasn't made in the 90's. I coppied and 
I pasted the links from the head sections of our labs, and then I had hello world in helvetica displayed
on my webpage.  Perhaps all the helvetica will start look very dated and we will all go back to times
new roman for that vintage 90's look.  But for now I like it.

making the navabar
problem: cant see text inside navbar
solution: bg-color changes the background color but not sure what what navbar-dark is doing.  Sovled the 
problem by having the text in <a> </a> tags.  bootrap then colors it appropriately 

problem: links are on top of each other rather than side to side encountered same problem in homework
solution: use navbar-expand class for div inside navbar container.  I didn't really want it to collapse. 
although I'm not exactly sure what the colapsable navbar does.  most of the examples on the website include
collapsable class, but I think I want something more basic

navbar list elements- actice makes them light up when you hover.  keeping this.

body
problem: trying to add a picture but just shows icon that says responsive image
Notes: downloaded it to my mac and them scp to get it into public html folder.  no change.  
just using src=http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~edeposit/grass.jpg.  looked at network tab of developers tools,
and there is a 404 not found for the image.  
Solution: I just used the file name as the src assuming it would fetch it from the current directory.  

adding a second page
problem: page would load
Notes: i tried just http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~edeposit/aboutme/, but nothing happend.  then I tried
./aboutme/ because I was thinking it would work the same way as the picture.  Then I looked at some command line 
isntructions about how to make webpage for some other schools public_html folder and found just the information
which is just he sort of instructions I needed.

problem: image took up whole page
solution: put it in div and add class img-fluid so it spans accross parent div and no farther
